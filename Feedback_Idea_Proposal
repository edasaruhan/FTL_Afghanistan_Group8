Develop a mobile-friendly interface for the service mapping app to ensure accessibility for field workers and local communities.
Include localized language support (Dari and Pashto) to ensure usability across diverse populations.
Integrate real-time feeds from humanitarian organizations or IoT devices to provide up-to-date service availability and risk predictions.
Highlight how the project can be scaled to other conflict-affected regions or expanded to include additional features like education or livelihood support services.

These are suggestion, overall really nice project. Thank you :)
